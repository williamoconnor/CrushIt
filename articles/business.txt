Businesses to start: IF YOU AREN'T WORKING 17 HOURS A DAY, YOU AREN'T AN ENTREPRENEUR

High startup cost
_ Yoga studio
_ Restaurant / Food Truck (Franchise?)
_ Coffee shop with great hours and wifi (good vibes for productive people)
_ app with date ideas - Ripple style payment, but with money. Need to somehow verify that they actually did the date. Check in?
_ app for newbs in a city - must have some way to meet people, a calendar of events, and also something like those date ideas with stuff to do on the weekend
_ app for friends (or strangers) where they partner up and it reminds the users everyday to work on their goal, and asks what they did. It also tells the partner how the other person did that day, and allows for a message response - one message for encouragement, not a convo. Basically allows people to make commitments to each other / groups
_ HelpMeShop app - probably start this with Brent*
_Party cruise/barge (fleet of options?) - different options for theme - dj and dance floor, formal dinner, company happy hour, shit show, etc. Has to have badass website
	big questions:
		where to buy the vessel?
		where to store the vessel?



Low startup cost
_ app development company***** (maybe offer design and business help as well)
_ wp dev company(make themes, do consulting)*****
_ party company (dj, photography, bar tending, etc.)***
_ advising for startups - or literally anything. similar to helpMeText...maybe get Brent in on this. Experts can get on and post they're expertise and their rate/ agreement about correspondence, and people who are interested in their expertise (whether it is diet, exercise, startup, career/school navigation, or dating) can pay for access*******
	- get the money from Brent and then try to get in on this maybe
	- I need to own the experts - they aren't rando's
_ dance classes ? I wish I knew how to dance, and it hasn't been easy to figure it out. Maybe go to people's houses or something to make it easy (as in hire coaches that I like to go to people's houses) ***
_ Ripple**5
_ Teach UT kids how to make apps
_ Setting Startup in Motion Class (need experience first)
_ Rubber duck succulents

Topics to think about

cheap travel
apps that simply integrate a bunch of APIs so I don't write much

high cost
IOT
some app to help people get out of bed - really just needs to flash light and not let them turn it off until they complete some task that requires alertness

low cost
Coffee shop scene in Austin
Something where we shop for people - send them outfits or something
something to sell at TX Running company
something to help startups
cheap shades - that thing camo was talking about

Random Notes:
- Probably need to blog about something so I have an audience
- Get jobs on the side until I can quit work, and then move from there
